# Week 4 – Exercise 1 Archiving Data

As you’ve seen, there is no use in keeping your archaeological data if no one (you included) can access them after their first use. An important step in any modern archaeological project is choosing an appropriate data archive that will ensure your information will be preserved for others to use, in ways (file types) that will allow them to be used by all current and (hopefully) future software. 

So which archive is __best__? 
Good question.
The answer is usually not about best or worst, but which works best for the project at hand. Let’s explore some archiving options:
-	[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) - a repository for open science data, supported by CERN and the European Commission.
-	[Archaeological Data Service](https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/) (ADS) - a repository with a mission to “provide digital archiving facilities for all areas of the world in which UK archaeologists have research interests”
-	[Open Context](https://opencontext.org/) - Open Context is a publisher and not a repository in itself, but it works with the California Digital Library to store organized, linked archaeological data from around the world.
-	[The Digital Archaeological Record](https://www.tdar.org/) (tDAR) - an archaeology-specific repository maintained and governed by Digital Antiquity and Arizona State University. tDAR archives a wide variety of archaeological media. 


_Descriptions come from [ODAT 2.2](https://o-date.github.io/draft/book/designing-data-collection-and-curation.html). For addition archives, see that chapter_. 

You are going to spend some time exploring each archive and learning for yourself the benefits, drawbacks, differences, and similarities between them. (When you delve into Zenobo, limit your searches to archaeological data) 

Visit each of the archives mentioned above and read about their missions, look into their policies on depositing data, their pricing structure (if they have one), the types of data they accept, etc. You will use this exploration to write part of your blog posting. 
+ _What are the major differences between these archives, and what would influence the choice to deposit data in one versus another? Would the type of data you had affect your choice?_  
    
+ _Do you see any similarities in the standards for data types in these archives? What types of files are archived, why do you think those are chosen?_ 

This is a good opportunity to familiarize yourself with the data that is available to you (**freely!**). It will come in very handy when you work on your final project.
